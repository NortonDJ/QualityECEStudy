Topics: Web server/client
Author: Darren Norton, Yizhong Chen

Introduction: In this project, we built up a simulation of a web browser and the corresponding network. We firstly implemented transmission delay, propagation delay and handshaking to layers. Then, we implement HTTP protocols with two certain formats for request and response. The client/ Server support GET method and are able to use if-modified header. The client contains a cache. And the server is able to produce several basic responses, such as ‘200’, ‘304’ and ‘404’. We also built up MarkUp to read and find out embedded files. What’s more, we have a ‘Dump’ command which can let severs send all files to client. More details will be explained as follows.

How to use: 
TO USE SERVER/CLIENT
1. First run ServerApp.java, then run ClientApp.java; 
For doing this, type in terminal: "java SeverApp amount_of_trans._delay amount_of_prop._delay"
Then, type: "java ClientApp version"; the version would be either 1.0f or 1.1f.
Then in the terminal of client, type in the filename you want

TO USE Dumping
1. First run ImprovedServerApp.java, then run DUMPClientApp.java; 
For doing this, type in terminal: "java ImprovedServerApp amount_of_trans._delay amount_of_prop._delay"
Then, type: "java DUMPClientApp version"; the version would be either 1.0f or 1.1f.

I've never heard of Olin College. Amazing just how many universities the US has.

Olin is a tiny school, like less than 1000 students total I believe; they don't have a grad school, either. But their undergraduate program is seriously on par with places like MIT and CalTech. It's incredibly difficult to get in, but all the students I've met there are very intelligent and hardworking people. :)

Is it amazing? Ther're telling every kid they can't succeed without doing it and giving anyone regardless of grades more or less unlimited loans. So you have customers who are a captive audience.
A lot of our colleges suck.

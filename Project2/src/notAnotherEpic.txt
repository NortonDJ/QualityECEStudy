1. Scene One: Regression


[H:]
"Close your eyes and begin to relax. Take a deep breath, and let it out
slowly. Concentrate on your breathing. With each breath you become more
relaxed. Imagine a brilliant white light above you, focusing on this light as
it flows through your body. Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and
deeper into a more relaxed state of mind. Now as I count backward from ten to
one, you will fill more peaceful, and calm. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. You
will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. Five. Four. Three. Two. If
at any time you need to come back, all you must do is open your eyes. One."

[N:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind
Starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again

Nothing seems real
I`m starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream

And as I draw near
The scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen

Hello Victoria so glad to see you
My friend

3. II. Strange Deja Vu


[N:]
Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can`t wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There`s another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now - Slowly coming into view
I`ve arrived - Blinding sunshine beaming through

There`s a house I`m drawn into
Familiar settings, nothing new
There`s a pathway leading there
With a haunting chill in the air

There`s a room at the top of the stairs
Every night I`m drawn up there
There`s a girl in the mirror
Her face is getting clearer
Young child won`t you tell me why I`m here?

In her eyes - I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise - There`s something tearing
At her soul

[V:]
Tonight I`ve been searching for it
A feeling that`s deep inside me
Tonight I`ve been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I`m not the one the sleeper thought he knew

[N:]
Back on my feet again
Eyes open to real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror`s shattered the girl

Why is this other life
Haunting me everyday
I`d break through the other side
If only I`d find the way

Something`s awfully familiar
The feeling`s so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world
It`s a link that I`m destined to make

I`m still searching but I don`t know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind`s door

Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won`t go away
Today I am searching for it
The one that I only know
Trying to break free

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I`m not the one I thought I always knew

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Uncanny, strange Deja Vu
But I don`t mind - I hope to find the truth


4. Scene Three: I. Through My Words


[N:]
All your eyes have ever seen
All you`ve ever heard
Is etched upon my memory
I spoken through my words

All that I take with me
Is all you`ve left behind
We`re sharing one eternity
Living in two minds
Linked by an endless thread
Impossible to break


5. II. Fatal Tragedy


[N:]
Alone at night
I feel so strange
I need to find
All the answers to my dreams

When I sleep at night
I hear the cries
What does this mean?

I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him
He talked to me that night;

"Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?"
"This fatal tragedy was talked about for years"
Victoria`s gone forever
Only memories remain
She passed away
She was so young

Without love
Without truth
There can be no turning back

Without faith
Without hope
There can be no peace of mind

As the night went on
I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy
A mystery still today

I tried to get more answers
But he said, "You`re on your own"
Then he turned away and left me
As I stand there all alone
He said, "You`ll know the truth
As your future days unfold"

Without love
Without truth
There can be no turning back

Without faith
Without hope
There can be no peace of mind

[H:]
"Now it`s time to see how you died. Remember that death
is not the end but only a transition."


6. Scene Four: Beyond This Life


[Headline:] "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echoe`s hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide"

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he`d turned the weapon on himself

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said "I can`t love a wayward man"

She may have found a reason to forgive
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer`s pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

I feel there`s only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

All that we learn this time
(What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life


7. Scene Five: Through Her Eyes


[N:]
She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlight night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstances

Now that I`ve become aware
And I`ve exposed this tragedy
A sadness grows inside of me
It all seems so unfair

I`m learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate

In loving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died

And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby

As I lay awake in bed

And I know what it`s like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn`t given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I`ve been given so much more in life
I`ve got a son, I`ve got a wife

I had to suffer one last time
To grieve for her and say goodbye
Relieve the anguish of my past
To find out who I was at last

The door has opened wide
I`m turning with the tide
Looking through her eyes


8. Scene Six: Home


[The Sleeper:]
Shine-lake of fire
Lines take me higher
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired

Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can't shake this charade
The city's cold blood calls me home
Home it's what I long for
Back home where I belong

The city - it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow - eternity
My demons are coming to drown me

Help - I'm falling, I'm crawling
I can't keep away from its clutch
Can't have it, this habit
It's calling me back to my home

[The Miracle:]
I remember the first time she came to me
Poured her soul out all night and cried

I remember I was told there's a new love that's born
For each one that has died

I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can't resist myself
No matter how hard I try

Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I'll make her my wife
Her sweet temptations calls me home
Home it's what I long for
My home where she belongs

Her ecstasy - means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taking me to my home

Help - he's my brother, but I love her
I can't keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It's calling me back to my home

[Nicholas:]
Her story - it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me

Help - regression, obsession
I can't keep away from her touch
Leave no doubt, to find out
It's calling me back to my home


9. Scene Seven: I. The Dance Of Eternity


[Instrumental]


10. II. One Last Time


[N:]
It doesn`t make any sense
This tragic ending
In spite of the evidence
There`s something still missing

Heard some of the rumours told
A taste of one`s wealth
Did Victoria wound his soul?
Did she bid him farewell?

[V:]
One last time
We`ll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We`ll lay down today
One last time
We slowly fade away

[N:]
Here I am inside his home
It holds the many clues
To my suspicions
And as I`m standing here right now
I`m finally shown what I have always known

Coincidence I can`t believe
As my childhood dreams slowly come true

Are these her memories
Awakened through my eyes
This house has brought back to life

An open door
I walk on through
Into his bedroom

Feeling as cold as outside
The walls disappear
To some woman who`s screaming
A man pleads forgiveness
His words I cannot hear


11. Scene Eight: The Spirit Carries On


[N:]
Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?

They say " Life is too short"
"The here and the now"
And " You`re only given one shot"
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

[V:]
"Move on, be brave
Don`t weep at my grave
Because I`m no longer here
But please never let
Your memories of me disappear"

[N:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has help me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria`s real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I`m here
It`s perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on


12. Scene Nine: Finally Free


[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into
consciousness, remembering all you have learned.
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present,
Feeling peaceful and refresh.
Open your eyes Nicholas.

[Miracle:]
Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man
Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there`s still time
He`d seem hopeless and lost with this note
They`ll buy into the words that I wrote
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I`ve finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
I`d take my own life before losing you

[Victoria:]
Feeling good this Friday afternoon
I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon
He`s always had my heart
He needs to know
I`ll break free of the Miracle
It`s time for him to go
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I`ve finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
He`d kill his brother if he only knew
Their love renewed
They`d rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew
Then came a shot out of the night
"Open your eyes, Victoria"

[Sleeper:]
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
We fade away
As their bodies lie still
And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear
It all becomes clear
A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

[Nicholas:]
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I`m finally free
No longer
Torn in two
I learned about my life by living through you
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I`ve finally free
No longer
Torn in two
Living my own life by learning from you
We`ll meet again my friend
Someday soon
